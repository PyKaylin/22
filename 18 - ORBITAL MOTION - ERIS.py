# 
# ---
# This is a python programme which uses the Euler-Cromer technique to model the behaviour of a system over the next 1000 years. This system consists of the dwarf planet Eris and the Sun. The programme will output a graph of the orbit on an x-y plane, from which the aphelion distance and a number of other factors can be determined. 
# <br>
# 
# The dwarf planet this programme will be modelling follows a highly eccentric orbit. Its perihelion is 38.3 AU from the sun and it has a velocity of $ 1.22 $ $ AU yr^{-1} $. Its highly erratic motion can be described using the following linked second order ODEs:
# 
# $$ \frac {d^{2}x} {dt^{2}} = - \frac {GM}{r^3}x $$
# 
# $$ \frac {d^{2}y} {dt^{2}} = - \frac {GM}{r^3}y $$
# 
# $$ r = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}} $$
# 
# Where r is the orbital radius, G is the universal gravitational constant and M is the mass of the sun. In this case, the value of GM will be $ 4 \pi^{2}  AU^{3} yr^{-2} $.
# <br>
# 
# The kinetic energy per unit mass and the gravitational potential energy per unit mass will also be determined by this programme, which will output calculte and then output a plot of these two energy terms, along with the total energy per unit mass, as a function of time. From this, whether or not energy is conserved can be determined. These energy terms can be determined using the following equations:
# 
# $$ \frac {KE} {m} = - \frac {1}{2} (v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}) $$
# 
# $$ \frac {PE} {m} = - \frac {GM}{r} $$
# 
# Finally, the orbital period of Eris will be determined using the above equations and output by this programme.
# 
# * Input initial conditions
# * Input function to determine the number of steps required
# * Initialise displacement, velocity and time values
# * Calculate $r^{3}$ acceleration, velocity and displacement in each dimension using the Euler-Cromer technique
# * Output graphs of x versus y and y versus x to display orbital motion
# * Calculate and output the aphelion distance
# * Calculate kinetic, gravitational potential and total energies
# * Output graph of kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy and total energy as a function of time

# Next the Euler-Cromer loop must be created. The $r^{3}$ value is calculated first, which is common to both differential equations. Then, acceleration, velocity and displacement in each dimension is calculated.
# 
# The same for loop must be used for the x-dimension and y-dimension calculations due to the linked nature of the ODEs.

# Secondly, the results can be plotted to observe the shape of the orbit by plotting y against x. This will produce an elliptical orbit; a stable orbit with the Sun at one of the foci.

# 
# From the graph below, it can be noted that the velocity of Eris, in an elliptical orbit, is not constant. Thus, the kinetic energy is also not constant.

# The planet, Eris, on its elliptical orbit of the sun, converts energy back and forth between potential energy and kinetic, which will decrease and increase throughout its orbit.

# ---
# 
# From the graph produced below, it can be observed that the peaks in kinetic energy and troughs in potential energy indicate the points at which Eris is closest to the sun (perihelion), and the peaks in potential energy and troughs in kinetic energy indicate the points at which Eris is farthest from the sun (aphelion).

# Conservation of Energy
# ---
# 
# Is energy conserved in this system, consisting of the planet Eris orbiting around the Sun?
# 
# - To determine whether or not the energy of this system is conserved, one must consider the sum of all the kinetic and potential energies.
# 
#     - $ Total$ $Energy$ $=$ $Kinetic$ $Energy$ $+$ $Potential$ $Energy $
# 
# - The total energy must always remain the same for energy to be conserved
# 
# - We can observe from the graph above, that the total energy remains the same throughout the orbit of Eris around the sun, at approximately $-0.29$ $AU^{2} yr^{-2}$
# 
# It can therefore be concluded that energy is conserved
#

# Orbital Period
# ---
# 
# The orbital period of Eris, the amount of time taken for Eris to complete one orbit around the sun, can also be determined from our previous kinetic energy equation.
